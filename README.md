# Probabilistic-Analysis-of-Lightning-Strikes
In this project, data consisting of the peak currents delivered by lightning strikes in 
Johannesburg was analysed, and three different probability density functions were 
selected to fit the data best. Test statistics between the data and the approximations 
were performed to determine the quality of fit and the best probability density function 
was chosen.
